# Traneptora's Roll20 Cleanup Script

It's recommended to install the script with Tampermonkey.

## Using with Tampermonkey

This is a Tampermonkey script. You can install Tampermonkey from various web stores:
- Firefox: [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

Once Tampermonkey is installed, you can point your browser at the script URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traneptora/roll20-cleanup/refs/heads/dist/traneptora-roll20-fixes.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traneptora/roll20-cleanup/refs/heads/dist/traneptora-roll20-fixes.user.js). You should see something like this:

![tampermonkey install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traneptora/roll20-cleanup/refs/heads/main/img/tampermonkey-install.png)

Push Install, to install the script. Then, when you're on a roll20 page, right click anywhere that roll20 doesn't have a custom right-click menu:

![trigger script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traneptora/roll20-cleanup/refs/heads/main/img/trigger-script.png)

You should see something like this, which means it's going.

## If Tampermonkey Isn't Available

You can copy and paste the entirety of the script linked above into your browser console and push enter, although this is not recommended.
